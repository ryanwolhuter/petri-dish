# Petri Dish

I've always loved [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), so I decided to create my own, more biological-looking version of it.

## How to Use

Click random to get started with a whole mess of squirming organisms.

You can click anywhere on the dish to add a cell. Just remember, if the simulation is running and you try to create a lonely cell that's got no neighbors, it'll just die instantly because if a cell has fewer than two neighbors, it dies by underpopulation / loneliness!

If you want to draw your own cell pattern, first pause the simulation so that your cells don't die from loneliness.

The squishy animations really have a chance to shine when there's a whole bunch of cells on the dish and you hit pause. Give it a try!
